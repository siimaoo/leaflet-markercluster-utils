# Introduction

If you are here, we assume that you is familiar with the basics of the [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) library. If not, I recommend you to read the [Leaflet documentation](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html) first.
Also you should be familiar with [leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster) too.

## What is this?

Well, this isn't a plugin for Leaflet, this lib doesn't extend the Leaflet API. You can think of this as a lodash for leaflet.markercluster plugin. It's a collection of useful functions that you can use in your Leaflet projects (if you are using leaflet.markercluster too :D).

## Why?

I've been using leaflet and leaflet.markercluster (with React) for a long time and I spent a lot of time writing the same code over and over again. So I decided to create this lib to save my time and to share it with the community.

## This works with React? and Vue? and Angular?

Well, I've been using this lib with React, but it should work with any other framework (or vanilla). If you are using Vue or Angular and are having problems, please open an issue and I'll try to help you.
